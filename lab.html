        <p class="main-class">
            The City of Light draws millions of visitors every year with its unforgettable ambiance.<br>
            Of course, the divine cuisine and vast art collections deserve some of the credit as well.<br>
            The gentle River Seine rambles through the city, flanked by stately museums, centuries-old churches, <br>
            and blocks of Rococo- and Neoclassic-design architecture, further enhanced by cascading trees and glowing streetlamps.<br>
